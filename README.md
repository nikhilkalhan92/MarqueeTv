1. What was the brief for the example you have shared?

In a recent project, we developed a streaming service platform, the main goal was to create a rich, engaging, and highly accessible web experience that seamlessly brought the arts to users' homes.

2. What did you take into consideration to ensure the brief was met?

First, I ensured I had a comprehensive understanding of the brief by collaborating closely with the design and product teams via user stories & epics. We aimed to translate the 'Netflix for the Arts' concept into a user-friendly interface of a premium streaming service.

We looked at the following as key aspects of the project, that I needed to focus on to create a state of the art front end streaming service.

Responsive Design: I focused on creating an intuitive flow that facilitated users from discovery to engagement. This included clear calls-to-action for registration, a streamlined subscription process. And of course, accessible to different devices.

Performance Optimisation: I optimised all assets, implemented lazy loading for media content = faster load times, Size Optimization: Automatically serve correctly sized images for each device

next.js imgae outof the box ith next.js provide the images which automaticcaly optimises the images.

Accessibility and Inclusivity: I ensured compliance with WCAG guidelines

Collaborative Development: I worked in an Agile environment, regularly iterating based on feedback from stakeholders, QA testers, and user analytics. This allowed us to refine features and adjust to user needs continuously.

Technical Stack and SEO:
I used a modern technical stack including React, Next.js for server-side rendering to enhance SEO and improve performance. This approach also facilitated the integration with backend services through a well-defined API layer.

In conclusion, my technical expertise with a user-centric approach, I helped create a digital space that not only met the brief but also created an online community passionate about the arts which was vital.

3. What tools and technologies did you use on this project and why did you choose them?

HTML, JavaScript, CSS: I call them the foundational pillars of web development. HTML provides the structure, CSS handles presentation, and JavaScript enables interactivity. They are essential for any web project

React: I chose React because of its component-based architecture. reusable UI elements and a declarative approach to programming. This improves the development speed and ensures consistency throughout the application

Next.js: Leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR). improves the initial load time of the website,SSR boosts our SEO efforts because search engines can crawl the site more effectively when content is pre-rendered on the serve. The integration of Next.js also simplifies the development of API endpoints with its API routes feature, which allows for seamless communication with the backend services.

These technologies offered a balance of speed, efficiency, and user experience, all while catering to our SEO and performance needs.

The stack chosen also supports future growth, allowing us to scale and enhance our platform as the user base grows and new features are demanded

4. Is there anything you would have done differently in hindsight?

Hindsight provides valuable insights for personal and professional development. I would have advocated for even earlier user testing sessions. Implementing a more robust CI/CD pipeline early on could have streamlined our development process, reduced manual errors, and accelerated the overall time to deployment. project has its set of unique challenges, and while the outcome was successful, these considerations would have further enhanced our efficiency and the product's impact
