# 1. What was the brief for the example you have shared?

 In a recent project, we developed a streaming service platform, the main goal was to create a rich, engaging, and highly accessible web experience that seamlessly brought the arts to users' homes.

Marquee TV initially built its platform on Angular, but as the need for modernization arose, the decision to upgrade to React was made due to its popularity and robust ecosystem. However, recognizing the potential benefits of server-side rendering for image-heavy content, the proposal to migrate to Next.js gained traction within the team. Next.js's capability to render on the server side offered a significant advantage, especially for efficiently delivering picture content to users. The transition to Next.js promised not only improved performance but also better SEO and user experience. The consensus among the team was overwhelmingly positive, as they saw the move as a strategic step towards enhancing the platform's functionality and competitiveness in the market.

# 2. What did you take into consideration to ensure the brief was met?

#### First, I ensured I had a comprehensive understanding of the brief by collaborating closely with the design and product teams via user stories & epics. We aimed to translate the 'Netflix for the Arts' concept into a user-friendly interface of a premium streaming service.

#### We looked at the following as key aspects of the project, that I needed to focus on to create a state of the art front end streaming service.

#### Responsive Design: I focused on creating an intuitive flow that facilitated users from discovery to engagement. This included clear calls-to-action for registration, a streamlined subscription process. And of course, accessible to different devices.

#### Performance Optimisation: I optimised all assets, implemented lazy loading for media content = faster load times, Size Optimization: Automatically serve correctly sized images for each device

#### Accessibility and Inclusivity: I ensured compliance with WCAG guidelines

#### Collaborative Development: I worked in an Agile environment, regularly iterating based on feedback from stakeholders, QA testers, and user analytics. This allowed us to refine features and adjust to user needs continuously.

# 3. Technical Stack and SEO:
#### I used a modern technical stack including React, Next.js for server-side rendering to enhance SEO and improve performance. This approach also facilitated the integration with backend services through a well-defined API layer.

#### In conclusion, my technical expertise with a user-centric approach, I helped create a digital space that not only met the brief but also created an online community passionate about the arts which was vital.

# 4. What tools and technologies did you use on this project and why did you choose them?

#### HTML, JavaScript, CSS: I call them the foundational pillars of web development. HTML provides the structure, CSS handles presentation, and JavaScript enables interactivity. They are essential for any web project

#### React: I chose React because of its component-based architecture. reusable UI elements and a declarative approach to programming. This improves the development speed and ensures consistency throughout the application

#### Next.js: Leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR). improves the initial load time of the website,SSR boosts our SEO efforts because search engines can crawl the site more effectively when content is pre-rendered on the serve. The integration of Next.js also simplifies the development of API endpoints with its API routes feature, which allows for seamless communication with the backend services.

#### These technologies offered a balance of speed, efficiency, and user experience, all while catering to our SEO and performance needs.

#### The stack chosen also supports future growth, allowing us to scale and enhance our platform as the user base grows and new features are demanded

# 5. Is there anything you would have done differently in hindsight?

#### Hindsight provides valuable insights for personal and professional development. I would have advocated for even earlier user testing sessions. Implementing a more robust CI/CD pipeline early on could have streamlined our development process, reduced manual errors, and accelerated the overall time to deployment. project has its set of unique challenges, and while the outcome was successful, these considerations would have further enhanced our efficiency and the product's impact

    * Begin by assessing the current Angular application to understand its architecture, dependencies, and features.
    * Identify the reasons for migrating to Next.js, such as improved performance, SEO benefits, or better developer experience.
    * Plan the migration process, considering factors like timeline, resource allocation, and potential challenges.
# 2. Setup Next.js Project:
# 3. Code Refactoring:
    * Review the existing angular 4 codebase and identify components, services, and other Angular-specific constructs that need to be migrated.
    * Refactor Angular components into React components, considering differences in syntax, lifecycle methods, and state management.
    * Migrate Angular services to Next.js API routes or utility functions, ensuring compatibility with the new framework.
    * Styling and UI Components:
    * Review styling approaches used in the Angular app (e.g., CSS, SCSS, CSS-in-JS) and migrate them to Next.js.
    * Leverage Next.js's support for CSS modules, styled-components, or other styling solutions.
    * Refactor UI components to align with React's component-based architecture and best practices.
# 4. Testing and Quality Assurance:
    * Develop a testing strategy to ensure the functionality and performance of the migrated Next.js application.
    * Write unit tests for components, API routes, and utility functions using testing frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library.
    * Conduct integration tests to validate data fetching, routing, and state management.
# 5. Deployment and Optimization:
    * Prepare the Next.js application for deployment to production environments.
    * Optimize the build process, including bundling, minification, and code splitting, to improve performance.
    * Configure server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) for better SEO and initial load times.
# 6. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:
    * Document the migration process, including any challenges faced and solutions implemented.
    * Share knowledge and best practices with team members to ensure a smooth transition and facilitate ongoing maintenance.

# Experience working in Agile or other cross-functional teams

# Project Context:
At Marquee TV, we transitioned our platform to Next.js to improve performance, scalability, and user experience. This project required close collaboration within an Agile, cross-functional team consisting of front-end developers, back-end developers, designers, and product managers.
Agile Process:
In sprint planning, the team, including developers, Bas, and the Scrum Master, scores user stories based on complexity and priority, allocating specific capacity to each developer. User stories are categorized by complexity, with less complex stories assigned lower scores and higher complexity stories receiving higher scores. The team then locks the scope by assigning resources to the allocated stories, ensuring efficient utilization of the three-week sprint duration. Using a Sprint Kanban converter, the team tracks the development and ongoing testing process, addressing any P1 and P2 defects that may arise during the sprint.


# My Role and Contribution:
As a front-end developer, I was responsible for migrating key components of the user interface to Next.js. I collaborated closely with designers to ensure the new components met our high UX standards and with back-end developers to integrate seamlessly with our APIs.
# Example: Homepage Redesign
One specific example was the homepage redesign. We aimed to reduce load times and improve navigation. During a sprint, I developed reusable React components and optimized image loading using Next.js features like image optimization and static generation. I also wrote unit tests to ensure the reliability of these components.
# Collaboration and Communication:
Throughout the sprint, we held daily stand-ups to discuss progress and blockers. Regular code reviews and pair programming sessions with team members ensured high code quality and facilitated knowledge sharing. At the end of the sprint, we demonstrated our progress during the sprint review and gathered feedback for continuous improvement.
Outcome:
# BA provide 
The transition to Next.js resulted in a significantly faster, more responsive homepage, leading to a 20% increase in user engagement and positive feedback from our users. This experience highlighted the importance of Agile principles in delivering high-quality, user-focused solutions efficiently.
